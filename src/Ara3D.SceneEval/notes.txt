This is probably not a good standalone library. 
There might be something necessary for the rest of the SDK, I will have to look at that. 
Otherwise it is becoming very much tied to my specific use case.
For example it assumes attributes on modifiers.

There is some big room for optimization. A scene eval graph can be compiled on demand,
and generate actual code, rather than doing everything dynamically. 
This will help for complex scenes.
