# Ara3D.IO.GeoJson

A library for reading and writing GeoJSON and IMDF data. 

## GeoJSON

GeoJSON is a geospatial data interchange format based on JavaScript
Object Notation (JSON).  It defines several types of JSON objects and
the manner in which they are combined to represent data about
geographic features, their properties, and their spatial extents.
GeoJSON uses a geographic coordinate reference system, World Geodetic
System 1984, and units of decimal degrees.
